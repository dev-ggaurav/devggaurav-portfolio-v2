Hello! If you are a beginner frontend developer and/or UI designer and looking for websites to find project ideas and design inspiration, you have come to the right place. In this article, I am going to list the top 5 resources that I personally use to find inspirations for my projects. Let's dive straight into it!

UI Design Daily is a website created by  [Ildiko](https://twitter.com/Ildiesign), a designer and interface developer based in Bergen, Norway. This is a fantastic website if you want some inspiration for app components, web components, landing page designs, etc. And New designs are uploaded pretty much every day. The license of this website includes editing, modifying, or copying the designs for free and without giving any attributions but giving credits is always appreciated.
